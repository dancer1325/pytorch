PyTorch documentation
===================================

* PyTorch
  * == tensor library
    * optimized
    * for deep learning -- via -- GPUs & CPUs
  * features / classified -- by -- release status
    * **Stable (API-Stable):**
      * maintained long-term
      * well documented
      * expectation: backwards compatibility
        * if there are breaking changes -> noticed | 1 previous release
    * **Unstable (API-Unstable):**
      * == ALL features / are under active development 
        * APIs may change -- based on -- user feedback, requisite performance improvements or lack of coverage ACROSS operators
